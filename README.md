# Green Up - Priceline for Golf

Green Up is a simple and elegant service that allows users to pay what they want to pay to play a round of golf.

## How it works

Users log on. They can then narrow the search to how far they're willing to drive. From there, they can put when the want to play and how much they are willing to pay.

These bids go to all the golf courses in the area and the courses can choose whether or not to accept it.

The user then gets a text if they accept or decline along with a link to the site.

If they accept, the user can then pay for it and officially make the reservation!

## What was this project for?

This project was made for the NBC Universal Hackathon 2015! It was an incredible expirence and we would love to go again if it were to come back! 

Specifically, this project was for the GolfNow challenge:

"GolfNow is the worldwide leader in the distribution and sale of online tee times. Its desktop and mobile products interact with a robust internal database of tee time inventory at 6,000 courses around the world, with daily availability of 500,000-600,000 tee times. GolfNow is especially focused on finding innovative ways of optimizing utilization by increasing the booking of tee times that are about to expire (1-4 golfers). GolfNow can aid course partners by proactively surfacing tee times that are about to expire and offering super deals to entice golfers to book a round and get to the course as quickly as possible.

GolfNowâ€™s challenge is to use its tee times API to design an innovative new way to target and engage users of tee times that are about to expire (1-4 golfers) and to incentivize them to book through discounts and other means. Examples could include: creating an auction/bidding process, a notification mechanism, a queueing process, hooks into social platforms, and many other possibilities."

## Technologies

As an extention of this project, we also contributed to [The Uber Bots](https://github.com/tylerl0706/TheUberBots). When a twitter user tweeted with the hashtag "#IWantToGolf" they would instantly receive a tweet that plugged GolfNow and Green Up.
